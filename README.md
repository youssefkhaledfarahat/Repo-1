# SQL Student Portal & Database

In this project we implemented an SQL database with multiple funtions that unregistered and registered users can access. From the simple Login/Logout, to the more advanced Scheduling of classes, Room bookings and time slot availability, and Course signup process. The Users that were part of the project were the students themselves, and the various faculty that are part of the insistution of an educational organization.
